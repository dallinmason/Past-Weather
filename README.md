# Past-Weather
A Dataset Documenting Past Weather in Salt Lake City, Utah

# Contents

This repository contains past weather collected in Salt Lake City over the past 26 days starting on Monday, September 19, 2022 and ending on Friday, October 14, 2022 just after noon. It focuses on key weather statistics that are interesting in analyzing patterns of weather changes that occur as the seasons change. Right now, it is transitioning into Fall and therefore we are most interested in finding out how that transition occurs in Utah and how gradual that is.

Below will be posted the code that I used to scrape the website https://www.localconditions.com/weather-salt-lake-city-utah/84101/past.php.
