# Past-Weather
A Dataset Documenting Past Weather in Salt Lake City, Utah

# Contents

This repository contains past weather in two files collected in Salt Lake City over the Fall of 2022. Weather(1).csv shows weather data starting on September 19, 2022 and ending on October 14, 2022 just after noon. Later_weather.csv shows data from October 19, 2022 to Novemeber 11, 2022. This data focuses on key weather statistics that are interesting in analyzing patterns of weather changes that occur as the seasons change. Right now, it is transitioning into Fall and therefore we are most interested in finding out how that transition occurs in Utah and how gradual that is.

Below will be posted the code that I used to scrape the website https://www.localconditions.com/weather-salt-lake-city-utah/84101/past.php.
